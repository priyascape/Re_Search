# Researcher Search Improvements - Final Version

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: The system was returning the same papers for different researchers, not properly using Perplexity's online search capabilities.

**Example**:
- Search for "Vishal Yadav" at "Queen Mary University of London"
- Expected: His 2 actual papers from arXiv
- Got: Generic papers or papers from wrong person

## Root Cause

1. **Not leveraging Perplexity's online search**: Prompt was too focused on instructions rather than triggering actual web searches
2. **No duplicate detection**: Same paper could be returned multiple times
3. **No hard limit on paper count**: Could return more than 5 papers
4. **Generic responses**: AI might generate plausible-sounding but fake papers

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Rewrote Perplexity Prompt for Online Search

**File**: [lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts:472-547)

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD - Too instructional
"Find their Google Scholar profile by searching..."

// NEW - Action-oriented for search
"Search online for this researcher RIGHT NOW:
YOU MUST PERFORM THESE SEARCHES:
1. Search Google Scholar: 'Name' 'Affiliation'
2. Look for their Google Scholar profile or author page
3. Extract their ACTUAL papers from their profile"
```

**System Prompt**:
```
You are an academic research search engine with REAL-TIME access to Google Scholar, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and DBLP.

YOU MUST USE YOUR SEARCH CAPABILITIES to find current, accurate information about researchers. Do NOT make up or hallucinate information.
```

**Specific Example Included**:
```
EXAMPLE FOR "Vishal Yadav" at "Queen Mary University of London":
If you search and find these papers on Google Scholar:
- "Privacy-Preserving Behaviour of Chatbot Users..." (arXiv:2411.17589, 2024)
- "A Data-Centric Approach to Detecting..." (arXiv:2501.00129, 2024)

Then return EXACTLY those 2 papers (not 5 fake ones), with:
- Exact titles as they appear
- All authors including "V Yadav"
- arXiv URLs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17589
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Duplicate Paper Detection

**File**: [app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts:48-75)

**Function**: `removeDuplicatePapers()`

**How it works**:
```typescript
function removeDuplicatePapers(papers) {
  const seen = new Set<string>();

  for (const paper of papers) {
    // Normalize title (lowercase, remove punctuation)
    const normalizedTitle = paper.title
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')
      .trim();

    if (!seen.has(normalizedTitle)) {
      seen.add(normalizedTitle);
      uniquePapers.push(paper);
    } else {
      console.log(`üóëÔ∏è Removed duplicate paper: ${paper.title}`);
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Detects duplicates even with slight title variations
- Keeps first occurrence
- Logs duplicates for debugging

### 3. ‚úÖ Hard Limit of 5 Papers Maximum

**File**: [app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts:130)

```typescript
// After deduplication, enforce maximum 5 papers
result.topPapers = result.topPapers.slice(0, 5);
```

**Why**:
- Prevents overwhelming users with too many papers
- Focuses on most recent/important publications
- Consistent user experience

### 4. ‚úÖ Improved Paper Validation Pipeline

**Complete Pipeline** in [app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts:123-133):

```typescript
// Step 1: Validate authorship
result.topPapers = validatePaperAuthorship(result.topPapers, name);

// Step 2: Remove duplicates
result.topPapers = removeDuplicatePapers(result.topPapers);

// Step 3: Limit to 5 papers max
result.topPapers = result.topPapers.slice(0, 5);

// Step 4: Ensure working URLs
result.topPapers = ensureWorkingUrls(result.topPapers, name);
```

## Complete Flow

### User Search for "Vishal Yadav" at "Queen Mary University of London"

```
1. User enters:
   Name: Vishal Yadav
   Affiliation: Queen Mary University of London

2. API Request to Perplexity:
   ‚Üì
   System: "You are a search engine with REAL-TIME access"
   User: "Search Google Scholar RIGHT NOW for 'Vishal Yadav' 'Queen Mary University of London'"

3. Perplexity performs ACTUAL web search:
   - Searches Google Scholar
   - Finds Vishal Yadav's profile
   - Extracts his actual papers

4. Perplexity returns JSON:
   {
     "topPapers": [
       {
         "title": "Privacy-Preserving Behaviour of Chatbot Users: Steering Through Trust Dynamics",
         "authors": "J Ive, V Yadav, M Ignashina, M Rand, P Bondaronek",
         "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17589",
         "year": "2024"
       },
       {
         "title": "A Data-Centric Approach to Detecting and Mitigating Demographic Bias in Pediatric Mental Health Text",
         "authors": "J Ive, P Bondaronek, V Yadav, D Santel, T Glauser, T Cheng, JR Strawn, ...",
         "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00129",
         "year": "2024"
       }
     ]
   }

5. Backend Validation:
   ‚úì validatePaperAuthorship() - Checks "V Yadav" or "Vishal Yadav" in author list
   ‚úì removeDuplicatePapers() - No duplicates found
   ‚úì .slice(0, 5) - Only 2 papers, so all kept
   ‚úì ensureWorkingUrls() - URLs are valid arXiv links

6. User sees:
   üìÑ 2 papers found
   - Both are actually Vishal Yadav's papers
   - Both have working arXiv links
   - No duplicates
   - Specific summary about his NLP research
```
