# 🧠 Perplexity ReSearcher

**Where Research Papers Meet Real Problems** — Create opportunities by connecting conference-accepted researchers with organizations through grounded, evidence-based reasoning.

Built for the **Perplexity London Hackathon 2024** to inspire curiosity, seek knowledge, and reason through the complex task of matching human expertise to unsolved problems.

---

## 🌍 What It Does

ReSearcher helps people and organizations **ask better questions — and reason their way to better answers.**

**For Organizations:** Instead of asking *"Who has AI safety on their resume?"*, ask *"Who has demonstrated deep reasoning about guardrails oversight?"* — and get evidence-backed answers.

**For Researchers:** Your accepted paper becomes a living node of curiosity that autonomously connects you to problems you can help solve.

**Every paper, experiment, and idea becomes a living node in an evolving network of curiosity.**

---

## 🎯 The Complex Task We're Reasoning Through

**The Problem:**
- 40% of conference-accepted authors can't afford $4,700 to attend
- Companies pay $30K+ per hire to find researchers with specific expertise
- Traditional hiring uses keywords, not reasoning
- Research expertise is invisible until manually discovered

**The Reasoning Challenge:**
How do you connect demonstrated expertise (in papers) with problems that need that expertise (in job descriptions) — in a way that's verifiable, transparent, and grounded in evidence?

**ReSearcher's Answer:**
Use Perplexity's grounded search to reason through job descriptions, extract problem domains, search conference papers for demonstrated expertise, and generate evidence chains showing the connection.

---

## 💡 How ReSearcher Inspires Curiosity

### 1. **For Researchers: Discover Who Values Your Work**
Your paper on "debate-based oversight" might connect to:
- AI Safety roles at Anthropic
- Alignment research at OpenAI  
- Human-AI interaction at DeepMind

You discover: *"My curiosity about X connects to real-world problems at Y, Z"*

### 2. **For Organizations: Ask Better Questions**
Instead of: "Find me someone with 5 years ML experience"  
Ask: "Who has reasoned deeply about scalable oversight in AI systems?"

ReSearcher helps you **seek knowledge** from the research community through better questions.

### 3. **For the Network: Every Paper Becomes a Node**
Each accepted paper doesn't just sit in a repository — it becomes:
- A curiosity signal: *"This person is exploring X"*
- An expertise proof: *"They can reason through Y"*  
- A connection point: *"They might solve Z"*

The network evolves as people publish, experiment, and explore.

## 🧠 The Reasoning Process (How We Use Perplexity)

### **Complex Task: Match Expertise to Problems with Evidence**

```typescript
// 1. Organization asks a question
"Who can help us develop scalable oversight methods?"

// 2. ReSearcher uses Perplexity to reason about the question
extractExpertiseFromJob(jobDescription)
→ What domains of expertise would solve this?
→ ["scalable oversight", "debate mechanisms", "AI alignment"]

// 3. Seek knowledge across research papers
findResearchersWithExpertise(domains)
→ Search: OpenReview + arXiv + GitHub + Scholar
→ Which papers demonstrate this expertise?

// 4. Reason through the connections
mapResearcherExpertise(paper, jobRequirements)
→ How does this paper demonstrate expertise?
→ What evidence supports the connection?
→ "Section 3 proposes novel framework [citation]"
→ "Theorem 1 proves scalability [citation]"
→ "GitHub shows working implementation [link]"

// 5. Generate evidence-backed answer
Match: 96% - This researcher has demonstrated expertise
Evidence: [grounded citations from paper]
Confidence: Peer-reviewed, cited by safety teams, working code
```

**This is reasoning, not keyword matching.** Perplexity helps both sides ask better questions and get better answers.

## 🔬 Two Portals, One Reasoning Engine

### **🎓 Researcher Portal: Curiosity Creates Opportunity**

**The Journey:**
1. Your paper gets accepted at NeurIPS (curiosity rewarded)
2. Claim your profile from OpenReview
3. System reasons about what expertise your paper demonstrates
4. Discover organizations asking questions your work can answer
5. Accept sponsorship → Attend conference → Explore collaboration

**Inspiring Curiosity:**
- "Who else is curious about similar problems?" (Similar researchers)
- "What questions is the community asking?" (Trending papers)
- "Who values this type of thinking?" (Sponsorship matches)

### **💼 Recruiter Portal: Better Questions, Better Answers**

**The Journey:**
1. Describe your problem (not just requirements)
2. System reasons about what expertise would solve it
3. Searches research community for demonstrated understanding
4. Get evidence-backed matches with reasoning chains
5. Ask follow-up questions via Perplexity
6. Sponsor attendance to meet and collaborate

**Seeking Knowledge:**
- "Who has reasoned through this problem domain?"
- "What evidence shows they understand it deeply?"
- "How does their approach connect to our needs?"

## 🧠 Why Perplexity API is Essential

### **The Hackathon Brief: Help People Ask Better Questions**

ReSearcher does exactly this:

**Better Questions Organizations Can Ask:**
- "Who has reasoned deeply about scalable oversight?"
- "Which papers address human-AI alignment challenges?"
- "Who is currently exploring debate-based approaches?"

**Better Answers Through Grounded Search:**
- Not "5 candidates with 'AI safety' keyword"
- But "3 researchers with peer-reviewed contributions to scalable oversight, each with evidence chains showing expertise"

**The Reasoning Layer:**
- Extracts meaning from job descriptions (what problem needs solving?)
- Seeks knowledge from research papers (who has demonstrated this expertise?)
- Generates evidence chains (how does this paper prove understanding?)
- Enables follow-up questions (continuous reasoning, not one-shot)

**Without grounded search, this is impossible.** Traditional systems match text. Perplexity enables *reasoning* — understanding that "debate frameworks" relate to "scalable oversight" requires knowledge, not keywords.
