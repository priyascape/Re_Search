# üß† Re_Search

**Perplexity ReSearcher** ‚Äî an open reasoning graph that connects live research problems with the people actively learning to solve them.

Built with **Next.js** and powered by the **Perplexity API**, ReSearcher transforms the idea of hiring into a process of reasoning:  
organisations describe problems, researchers contribute conjectures, and the system grounds every match in verifiable evidence.

## üåç What It Does

ReSearcher creates a dynamic **Reasoning Graph** between researchers, papers, and real-world questions.

- **Researcher Portal** ‚Äì Claim your verified research profile (from Google Scholar, arXiv, NeurIPS, etc.) and publish ongoing reasoning, not static r√©sum√©s.  
- **Problem Portal** ‚Äì Organisations post open problems or project briefs; the system interprets them as hypotheses to be tested, not ‚Äújob openings.‚Äù  
- **Perplexity-Powered Reasoning** ‚Äì Each match is generated through grounded search and transparent citation chains, showing *why* a researcher‚Äôs work addresses a specific problem.  
- **Funding & Collaboration Loop** ‚Äì Sponsors can directly fund attendance, prototypes, or experiments, turning reasoning into opportunity.
