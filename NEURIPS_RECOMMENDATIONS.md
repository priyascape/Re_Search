# NeurIPS 2024 Paper Recommendations Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically recommends the top 5 most relevant NeurIPS 2024 papers to researchers based on their research interests and publication history.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Analysis
When a researcher views their profile:
1. System analyzes their top 3 publications
2. Extracts key research areas from paper titles
3. Calls Perplexity API to find matching NeurIPS 2024 papers
4. Returns top 5 papers ranked by relevance

### 2. Smart Matching
Each recommended paper includes:
- **Match Score** (0-100%): How well it aligns with researcher's work
- **Relevance Explanation**: Why this paper is relevant
- **Full Paper Details**: Title, authors, abstract, URL

---

## UI Components

### Location
Displayed on researcher profile page ([/researcher](app/researcher/page.tsx)) after profile header, before publications section.

### Visual Design
- **Purple gradient background** (from-purple-50 to-pink-50)
- **2-column grid** layout for desktop
- **Sparkles icon** next to title
- **Purple borders** with hover effects

### Card Layout
Each recommended paper shows:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ #1                    95% match    │
│                                    │
│ Paper Title (bold, 2 lines max)    │
│ Authors (small text)               │
│ Abstract (2 lines max)             │
│                                    │
│ Why relevant: [explanation]       │
│                                    │
│ [View Paper →]                     │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## User Experience

### Loading State
When fetching recommendations:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⟳ Finding relevant NeurIPS 2024    │
│   papers for you...                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Populated State
Shows 5 papers in 2-column grid (mobile: 1 column)

### Empty State
If no papers found or API fails, section is hidden (no error shown to user)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. **[app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts](app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts)**
   - New API endpoint for fetching NeurIPS 2024 papers
   - Uses Perplexity API to find relevant papers
   - Returns top 5 ranked by match score

### Files Modified
1. **[app/researcher/page.tsx](app/researcher/page.tsx)**
   - Added `RecommendedPaper` interface
   - Added `recommendedPapers` and `loadingRecommendations` state
   - Added `fetchRecommendations()` function
   - Added recommendations UI component
   - Imported `Sparkles` icon

### Research Area Extraction
Simple algorithm extracts keywords from paper titles:
```typescript
const areas = papers.slice(0, 3).map(p => {
  // Extract words > 5 characters
  const words = p.title.split(' ').filter(w => w.length > 5);
  // Take first 2 words per paper
  return words.slice(0, 2).join(' ');
}).join(', ');
```

**Example:**
```
Input Papers:
1. "Deep Learning Approaches to Computer Vision"
2. "Neural Networks for Image Recognition"
3. "Convolutional Architectures in Vision Tasks"

Extracted Areas:
"Learning Approaches, Neural Networks, Convolutional Architectures"
```

## Configuration

### Adjusting Number of Recommendations
Currently hardcoded to 5. To change:

**In API ([app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts](app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts)):**
```typescript
// Line 52: Change "TOP 5" to "TOP 10"
Find the TOP 10 most relevant papers...

// Line 98: Adjust slice
if (papers.length > 10) {
  papers = papers.slice(0, 10);
}
```

**In UI ([app/researcher/page.tsx](app/researcher/page.tsx)):**
```typescript
// Line 454: Change slice(0, 5) to slice(0, 10)
{recommendedPapers.slice(0, 10).map((paper, index) => (
```

### Conference Year
To change from NeurIPS 2024 to another year/conference:
- Update prompt in [app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts](app/api/researcher/recommendations/route.ts) line 52
- Change "NeurIPS 2024" to desired conference (e.g., "ICML 2025")

## Performance

### API Latency
- **Average:** 3-5 seconds
- **Max:** 10 seconds (with timeout)
- **Cached:** N/A (not cached currently)

### Optimizations
1. **Non-blocking**: Runs asynchronously, doesn't delay profile load
2. **Optional**: If fails, doesn't break page
3. **Concise Prompts**: Optimized for faster Perplexity response

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
1. **Caching**: Cache recommendations per researcher (30-min TTL)
2. **Filter by Topic**: Let user select specific research areas
3. **More Papers**: Option to "Show More" beyond 5

### Medium-term
1. **Bookmarking**: Save papers for later reading
2. **Email Digest**: Weekly email with new NeurIPS papers
3. **Citation Impact**: Show citation counts and h5-index

### Long-term
1. **Multi-Conference**: Aggregate from ICML, CVPR, ICLR, etc.
2. **Personalized Ranking**: ML model learns from user interactions
3. **Collaboration Suggestions**: Find co-authors based on shared interests

---

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Go to `/researcher`
2. Search for "Yann LeCun" at "New York University"
3. Wait for profile to load
4. **Check:** Purple "Recommended NeurIPS 2024 Papers" section appears
5. **Check:** 5 papers displayed in 2-column grid
6. **Check:** Each paper has match score, relevance explanation
7. Click "View Paper" link
8. **Check:** Opens actual paper URL

### Edge Cases
- **No publications**: Falls back to generic recommendations
- **API failure**: Section hidden, no error shown
- **Slow response**: Shows loading spinner, doesn't block page

---

## Conclusion

This feature enhances researcher profiles by automatically surfacing relevant NeurIPS 2024 papers, helping researchers stay current with the latest research in their field while providing recruiters with additional context about researcher interests.
