# UI & Scoring Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to reduce verbosity, improve critical scoring, and create a cleaner match presentation.

---

## 1. Reduced Verbosity ‚úÇÔ∏è

### Problem
- Match cards were too wordy and overwhelming
- Too much information displayed at once
- Skills section was verbose and unstructured
- Hard to scan quickly through multiple candidates

### Solutions

#### A. Condensed Match Summary
**Location:** [app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx](app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx:576-622)

**Before:**
- Showed ALL alignment points (3-5) upfront
- Showed ALL gaps upfront
- Displayed full extracted skills text
- ~200-300 words per card

**After:**
- Shows only **top 2 alignment points**
- Shows only **first gap** (if exists)
- Hides detailed skills in collapsed view
- **~50-80 words per card** (60-75% reduction)
- "View Full Analysis ‚Üí" link to expand

**Benefits:**
- Faster scanning of multiple candidates
- Less cognitive overload
- Focus on key strengths/weaknesses only

#### B. Concise Skill Extraction
**Location:** [app/api/recruiter/match/route.ts](app/api/recruiter/match/route.ts:66)

**Prompt Change:**
```typescript
// OLD: Verbose paragraph format
"Extract and list their key technical skills, research areas,
methodologies, and domain expertise..."

// NEW: Concise bullet format
"List ONLY the top 5-7 most relevant technical skills.
Be CONCISE - use bullet points with 3-5 words each
(e.g., 'Deep Learning', 'Computer Vision', 'PyTorch/TensorFlow').
No explanations, just skill names."
```

**Result:**
- Skills now show as clean bullet list
- 3-5 words per skill (was: 10-20 words)
- Maximum 7 skills (was: unlimited paragraphs)

---

## 2. Critical Scoring System üéØ

### Problem
- Scores were inflated (most candidates got 85-95%)
- No meaningful differentiation between candidates
- Scoring didn't reflect actual gaps or concerns
- Unrealistic expectations set for recruiters

### Solutions

#### A. Strict Scoring Guidelines
**Location:** [lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts:240-277)

**New Scoring Rubric:**
```
90-100: Perfect match (RARE - only if ALL requirements met + strong track record)
80-89:  Excellent match (most requirements + proven expertise)
70-79:  Good match (core requirements + some gaps)
60-69:  Moderate match (partial fit, significant gaps)
50-59:  Weak match (minimal overlap)
<50:    Poor match (major misalignment)
```

**Critical Prompts:**
```typescript
"Be CRITICAL. Don't inflate scores. Look for RED FLAGS:
- Lack of practical experience
- Missing key technical skills
- Insufficient publication record
- No evidence of claimed expertise"
```

**Expected Distribution:**
- Before: 90% of candidates scored 85-95%
- After: **Most candidates score 60-80%** (realistic range)

#### B. Updated Badge Display
**Location:** [app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx](app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx:452-471)

**Visual Changes:**
| Score Range | Color | Label | Border |
|-------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 85-100 | Emerald | Excellent | ‚úì |
| 75-84 | Teal | Good | ‚úì |
| 65-74 | Blue | Moderate | ‚úì |
| 50-64 | Yellow | Weak | ‚úì |
| <50 | Gray | Poor | ‚úì |

**Before:** Only 2 levels (90+ = green, 85+ = teal, else = blue)
**After:** 5 granular levels with clear labels

---

## 3. Detailed Analysis in Expanded View üìä

### Problem
- No place for comprehensive analysis
- Skills were either too brief OR too verbose
- Gaps/concerns lacked detailed explanation

### Solutions

#### A. Structured Detailed View
**Location:** [app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx](app/recruiter/matches/page.tsx:658-713)

**New Sections in Expanded View:**

1. **Complete Match Analysis**
   - All alignment points (not just top 2)
   - All gaps & concerns (not just first one)
   - Overall relevance assessment

2. **Technical Skills & Expertise**

   - Moved from condensed view

3. **Professional Summary**
   - Researcher's bio and background

4. **All Publications**
   - Complete paper list with abstracts

**Flow:**
```
