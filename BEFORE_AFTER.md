# Before & After Comparison

## Issue 1: Input Text Visibility

### Before ❌
```
User types: "John Smith"
What user sees: [nothing - white text on white background]
User experience: "Is this working? I can't see what I'm typing!"
```

### After ✅
```
User types: "John Smith"
What user sees: "John Smith" in clear black text
User experience: Perfect visibility, clear feedback
```

**Technical Fix**:
```tsx
// Before
className="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg"

// After
className="w-full px-4 py-3 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg bg-white text-black placeholder:text-gray-400"

## Issue 2: Paper Authorship Accuracy

### Before ❌
**Search**: "John Smith" at "MIT"

**Results Returned**:
1. ❌ "Deep Learning for Robotics" - Author: Jane Smith (wrong person!)
2. ❌ "Neural Networks in Vision" - Authors: J. Brown, M. Lee (no John Smith!)
3. ❌ "AI Safety Research" - Authors: Multiple people, no John Smith
4. ✅ "Computer Vision Methods" - Authors: John Smith, A. Kumar (correct!)
5. ❌ "Machine Learning Theory" - Authors: J. Williams (wrong!)

**Problem**: Only 1 out of 5 papers actually authored by John Smith!

### After ✅
**Search**: "John Smith" at "MIT"

**Perplexity AI Search**:
- Searches Google Scholar for "John Smith MIT"
- Finds 5 potential papers
- **Verifies author list for each paper**
- Only includes papers with verified authorship

**Backend Validation**:
```
Processing 5 papers from Perplexity...
✅ "Computer Vision Methods" - VERIFIED (John Smith found in authors)
❌ "Deep Learning for Robotics" - FILTERED (Jane Smith ≠ John Smith)
❌ "Neural Networks in Vision" - FILTERED (John Smith not in author list)
✅ "Image Processing Techniques" - VERIFIED (J. Smith found in authors)
❌ "AI Safety Research" - FILTERED (John Smith not in author list)
```

**Results Shown to User**:
1. ✅ "Computer Vision Methods" - Authors: John Smith, A. Kumar
2. ✅ "Image Processing Techniques" - Authors: J. Smith, R. Patel

**Result**: 2 out of 2 papers are ACTUALLY authored by John Smith!

```

### New System (Two-Layer Verification) ✅
```
User Input
    ↓
Perplexity AI Search
    ↓
AI Verification Layer 1:
    - Check Google Scholar author list
    - Verify name appears

    ↓
Backend Validation Layer 2:
    - Parse author names
    - Match researcher name
    - Filter non-matches
    - Log filtered papers
    ↓
Show ONLY Verified Papers to User
```
