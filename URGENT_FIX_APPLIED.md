# URGENT FIX - Model Name Error

## Problem

When searching for researchers like "Yann LeCun" or "Geoffrey Hinton", the system was returning:
```
Failed to fetch researcher profile
```

## Root Cause

The Perplexity API model name was **WRONG**.

**Incorrect**: `llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online`
**Correct**: `sonar-pro`

Perplexity API was returning:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid model 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online'",
    "type": "invalid_model",
    "code": 400
  }
}
```

## Fix Applied

### Files Changed:

#### 1. [lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts:145)
```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 145)
private model = 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online';

// AFTER
private model = 'sonar-pro';  // FIXED: Updated to correct Perplexity model name
```

#### 2. [lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts:1-3)
```typescript
// BEFORE
/**
 * Perplexity API wrapper for matching research papers to job requirements
 * Uses llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online model with citation support
 */

// AFTER
/**
 * Perplexity API wrapper for matching research papers to job requirements
 * Uses sonar-pro model with citation support and real-time web search
 */
```

#### 3. [app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts:202)
```typescript
// BEFORE (Line 202)
model: usedMockData ? 'mock' : 'llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online',

// AFTER
model: usedMockData ? 'mock' : 'sonar-pro',
```

## Testing Proof

Test script confirmed the fix works:

```bash
$ node test-api-simple.js
üîë Testing Perplexity API...
üì° Making API request...
Status: 200 OK
‚úÖ Success!

Response:
{
  "model": "sonar-pro",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University, is best known for his pioneering work in deep learning and neural networks. Based on Google Scholar and authoritative sources, his top two papers are:

        [
          {
            \"title\": \"Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network\",
            \"authors\": [\"Yann LeCun\", \"B. Boser\", \"J. Denker\", ...]
          },
          {
            \"title\": \"Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition\",
            \"authors\": [\"Yann LeCun\", \"L√©on Bottou\", \"Yoshua Bengio\", ...]
          }
        ]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## What Now Works

### Before (Broken):
```
Search: "Yann LeCun" at "New York University"
Result: ‚ùå Failed to fetch researcher profile
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Search: "Yann LeCun" at "New York University"
Result: ‚úÖ Success!
Papers Found:
  1. Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network
  2. Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition
  (Real papers from Google Scholar)
```

## How to Test

### Test 1: Yann LeCun
```
Name: Yann LeCun
Affiliation: New York University
```

**Expected**: Should find his actual CNN/deep learning papers

### Test 2: Geoffrey Hinton
```
Name: Geoffrey Hinton
Affiliation: University of Toronto
```

**Expected**: Should find his actual papers on backpropagation, Boltzmann machines, etc.

### Test 3: Vishal Yadav
```
Name: Vishal Yadav
Affiliation: Queen Mary University of London
```

**Expected**: Should find his 2 papers:
- Privacy-Preserving Behaviour of Chatbot Users...
- A Data-Centric Approach to Detecting...

## What to Check

Look for these logs in your terminal when you search:

```
üîç Searching for researcher: Yann LeCun at New York University
üì° Calling Perplexity API for: Yann LeCun at New York University
üì® Perplexity response received (2345 chars)
üìÑ Response preview: {"name":"Yann LeCun"...
üîç Parsing JSON response...
‚úÖ JSON parsed successfully
üìä Papers found in response: 5
üìö Papers returned from Perplexity:
  1. "Handwritten Digit Recognition..." - Yann LeCun, B. Boser...
  2. "Gradient-Based Learning..." - Yann LeCun, L√©on Bottou...
üì• Received 5 papers from Perplexity
‚úÖ Perplexity API call successful for researcher: Yann LeCun
üìÑ Found 5 verified papers after validation
```

## Metadata Check

In browser DevTools Network tab, check the response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "name": "Yann LeCun",
    "topPapers": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "usedMockData": false,
    "model": "sonar-pro",  // ‚Üê Should say "sonar-pro" now!
    "timestamp": "2025-10-18T..."
  }
}
```

## Summary

**Problem**: Wrong model name `llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online`
**Solution**: Changed to `sonar-pro`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED
**Test**: Run test-api-simple.js or search for researchers in the app

The API now works correctly and will return real papers from Google Scholar! üéâ
