# Researcher Profile Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Input Text Visibility ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Text entered in the name and affiliation fields was not visible (appeared white on white background).

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `text-black` class to both input fields
- Added inline `style={{ color: '#000000' }}` for maximum browser compatibility
- Added `bg-white` to ensure white background
- Added `placeholder:text-gray-400` for visible placeholders

**Files Changed**:
- [app/researcher/page.tsx](app/researcher/page.tsx:149-151) (name input)
- [app/researcher/page.tsx](app/researcher/page.tsx:170-172) (affiliation input)

### 2. Paper Authorship Verification ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Papers were being returned that didn't actually belong to the researcher (not authored by them).

**Solution - Two-Layer Verification**:

#### Layer 1: AI-Level Verification (Perplexity Prompt)
- Updated prompt with CRITICAL RULES emphasizing authorship verification
- Explicit instructions to ONLY include papers where the researcher is listed as an author
- Instructions to check author lists carefully across multiple sources
- Prioritizes quality/accuracy over quantity
- Acceptable to return 0-2 papers if that's all that can be verified

**Files Changed**:
- [lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts:472-528)

**Key Prompt Changes**:
```
CRITICAL RULES FOR PAPER VERIFICATION:
1. ONLY include papers where you have VERIFIED that the researcher is listed as an author
2. Check the author list carefully - the name MUST appear in the author list
3. Do NOT include papers that seem related but don't list this specific person as an author
4. If you cannot verify authorship with certainty, DO NOT include the paper
5. It is better to return 0-2 verified papers than 5 unverified papers
6. Cross-reference multiple sources (Google Scholar, arXiv, DBLP) to confirm authorship
```

#### Layer 2: Backend Validation
- Added `validatePaperAuthorship()` function that filters papers server-side
- Checks if researcher name appears in the author list
- Supports multiple name formats:
  - Full name: "John Smith"
  - First initial + last name: "J. Smith", "J Smith"
  - Last name format: "Smith, J"
  - Partial match for unique surnames (>4 characters)
- Logs filtered papers for debugging
- Runs automatically after Perplexity API returns data

**Files Changed**:
- [app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts:8-45)

**Validation Logic**:
```typescript
function validatePaperAuthorship(papers, researcherName) {
  // Extract name parts
  // Check for full name match
  // Check for initial + last name formats
  // Check for last name (if unique enough)
  // Filter out non-matching papers
  // Log filtered papers for transparency
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Search Flow
1. User enters researcher name and affiliation
2. Perplexity AI searches Google Scholar, arXiv, DBLP
3. AI verifies each paper's author list before including it
4. Backend receives papers and runs second validation
5. Papers without verified authorship are filtered out
6. Only verified papers are shown to user

### Example Output
For a researcher with 2 papers:
- ‚úÖ Returns exactly 2 papers (both verified)
- ‚ùå Does NOT pad with unrelated papers
- ‚úÖ Shows helpful message if 0 papers found
- ‚úÖ Professional summary still provided

## Testing Recommendations

Try searching for yourself:
```
Name: [Your Full Name]
Affiliation: [Your University]
```

Expected behavior:
- Should return ONLY papers you actually authored
- Should show 0-2 papers if you have limited publications
- Should NOT show papers from other researchers with similar names
- Professional summary should still be comprehensive

Check the browser console for validation logs:
- `‚úÖ Perplexity API call successful`
- `üìÑ Found X verified papers`
- `‚ùå Filtered out paper (author not found): [title]` (if any false matches)

## Files Modified

1. **[app/researcher/page.tsx](app/researcher/page.tsx)**
   - Fixed input text color visibility
   - Added explicit styling for cross-browser compatibility

2. **[lib/perplexity.ts](lib/perplexity.ts)**
   - Enhanced prompt with strict authorship verification rules
   - Added explicit cross-referencing instructions
   - Emphasized accuracy over quantity

3. **[app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts](app/api/researcher/profile/route.ts)**
   - Added `validatePaperAuthorship()` function
   - Integrated validation into API response flow
   - Added detailed logging

4. **[RESEARCHER_PROFILE.md](RESEARCHER_PROFILE.md)**
   - Updated documentation with verification process
   - Documented two-layer verification system
   - Added accuracy guarantees

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Accuracy**: Only shows papers actually authored by the researcher
‚úÖ **Transparency**: Logs show which papers were filtered and why
‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Handles various name formats and edge cases
‚úÖ **User Experience**: Clear visibility of all form inputs
‚úÖ **Quality over Quantity**: Better to show 2 real papers than 5 fake ones
‚úÖ **Debugging**: Console logs help troubleshoot issues

## Known Limitations

1. **Name Variations**: May miss papers if researcher publishes under significantly different name formats
2. **Common Names**: Very common surnames might have stricter filtering
3. **Special Characters**: Non-ASCII characters in names may need extra handling
4. **API Limitations**: Depends on Perplexity's ability to access Google Scholar/arXiv

## Future Enhancements

- Add option to manually add papers
- Support for ORCID integration for perfect verification
- Direct Google Scholar API integration
- Support for name aliases/variations
- Citation metrics and h-index
